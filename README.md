TravelVR 
========

This Web application allows you to travel around the world and watch all the places you want just staying home and watching Spherical Photos with your Google Cardbord or every VR viewer you have.

This is my Exam project and it's still in development.

I used the three.js library to render Sperical Photos and make them turn at the device Orientation change.

The idea is to have a map on the background where to put markers for user's photos. People can upload their photos to the application and via geolocalization i can get their position and get coordinates where to put the marker. Make spherical 360 photos is very simple: you can use professional cameras or just download the Google Fotocamera application that allows you to make them. Clicking a marker will redirect user to the VR view of that place or (if you don't have a VR viewer) to a normal spherical photo viewer.

For now you can give it a try just opening the link above with your smarthphone
